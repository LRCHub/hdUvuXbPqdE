Strip malls
Winter in the fall
It happened so slow I barely noticed it at all
Blank tapes
Try to stay awake
I'm running from the future but I can't escape it

They don't love you

All the seas
Ridden with disease
Bless the poor dog that gets eaten by the flees
Chickadee sitting next to me
Says mini televisions hang like bats in the trees now

We all love you

Mix tapes
Try to stay awake
Ride my rusty bicycle into the wave
