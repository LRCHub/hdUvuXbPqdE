Maybe red's like roses?
Maybe it's the pool of blood
The innocents will lay in
When in the end you've failed to save them

Their dying eyes
Are wide and white like snow
And now they know
The cost of trusting you's obliteration

Mirrors will shatter
Crushed by the weight of the world
The pillars collapse in shame

There'll be no rest
There'll be no love
There'll be no hero in the end
Who will rise above

And when it ends
The good will crawl
The shining light will sink in darkness
Victory for hate incarnate
Misery and pain for all
When it falls

Swallowed by the darkness
Soon the moon is bathed in black
The light of hope is taken
And discontent is the contagion

The blinding eyes
That burn a yellow flame
The embers that remain
Will light the fuse of condemnation

Kingdoms in tatters
Hung on the brink of a war
The peace will succumb to flames

This is not a tragedy
It's not an accident
You placed your faith in fools
And now you'll smother in lament

They play the part of allies
Claiming peace their only goal
But once the fight for power starts
They'll eat each other whole

Their iron gloves point fingers
They'll wage a war of blame
And mankind will wilt in pain

There'll be no rest
There'll be no love
There'll be no hero in the end
Who will rise above
And when it ends
The good will crawl
The shining light will sink in darkness
Victory for hate incarnate
Misery and pain for all
When it falls
