Time marches on never ending,
Time keeps it's own time
Here we stand at beginning,
And then goes passing us by,
And I, I, I can dream for us all,
I hope I'm in a better state,
When here and now crumbles and falls and you,
You, you who make worlds collide
I knew you'd come knocking one day,
Unannounced like a thief in the night.

So tell me how do you do
Finally I meet you
You don't know what I've been through,
Waiting and wondering about you
I had a dream my trip would end up at you,
And now I know paradise.

Tomorrow, tomorrow,
Tomorrow means nothing at all
If we don't hear the line,
When today places its call,
And morning, morning,
Morning, won't ever be the same,
Now I won't make the same mistakes,
Time and time again
Time and time again

So tell me how do you do
Finally I meet you
You don't know what I've been through,
Waiting and wondering about you

So tell me how do you do
Finally I meet you
You don't know what I've been through,
Waiting and wondering about you

So tell me how do you do
Finally I meet you
You don't know what I've been through,
Waiting and wondering about you

So tell me how do you do
Finally I meet you
You don't know what I've been through,
Waiting and wondering about you

So tell me how do you do
Finally I meet you
You don't know what I've been through,
Waiting and wondering about you
